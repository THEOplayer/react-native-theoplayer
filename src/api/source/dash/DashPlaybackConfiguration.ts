   * Whether to seamlessly switch between DASH periods.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The player supports two strategies for handling a switch between two periods in an MPEG-DASH stream:
   * <br/> - <strong>Seamless</strong>: Once the player is done buffering the current period, it immediately starts buffering the next period.
   *         This requires that the current period and the next period have compatible codecs and content protection, or that the platform
   *         supports buffering different codecs in a single player. Because the next period is preloaded ahead of time, this makes the actual
   *         switch between periods (almost) completely seamless.
   * <br/> - <strong>Hard</strong>: The player waits until playback reaches the end of the current period before buffering and playing the next
   *         period. Because the buffering is not done ahead of time, this may result in a noticeable stall at the start of the next period.
   *         However, this strategy does not require any special platform support, so it works on any platform or device.
   *
   * By default, the player will automatically choose between a seamless or a hard period switch based on the codecs and content protection of
   * the two periods, and the support information reported by the platform. However, if you notice that the player makes an incorrect decision
   * on certain streams or platforms, you can use this option to override its behavior as a stopgap solution. (You should still report this
   * problem to THEOplayer support, so we can improve the player's default behavior and you can remove this override.)
